/**
 * @brief A class template that provides some of the implementation details for
 * a dynamic array-based container.
 *
 * The `Darray_base` class template is intended to be used as a base class for a
 * dynamic array-based container. It provides a nested struct, `_Darray_impl`,
 * to store the data for the container, as well as member functions to access
 * and modify the `_Darray_impl` object.
 *
 * One of the key benefits of using Darray_base as a base class is that it
 * allows us to reuse code and reduce the amount of code you need to write and
 * maintain. For example, you can use `Darray_base` to provide the underlying
 * dynamic array storage and allocator functionality for your container, and
 * then focus on implementing the specific interface and functionality that you
 * want for your container.
 *
 * @tparam T The element type of the container.
 * @tparam Allocator The allocator type to use for allocating memory for the
 * container.

   * 
   * This can be used to create a new allocator object that is compatible with `Darray_base`, regardless of the original type of the allocator.
   * 
   * @note In C++11 and earlier, the `std::allocator` class template defined a nested type called `rebind`, which could be used to create a new allocator type that was parameterized with a different type. For example, you could use `std::allocator<int>::rebind<char>::other` to create an allocator type that could be used to allocate char objects, using an allocator that was originally designed to allocate int objects.
   * In C++17, the rebind type was deprecated and replaced with a rebind_alloc type trait, which is defined in the <memory> header file. To create a new allocator type that is parameterized with a different type.
